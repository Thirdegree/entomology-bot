    House centipedes are centipedes in the order Scutigeromorpha. They look a little bit different from the centipedes you may be used to! As centipedes, they do possess venom, but currently there are no known species of house centipede with venom that is medically significant to humans. Their main defensive strategy is to run and hide, as they are very quick. House centipedes are fantastic predators and many regard them as "free pest control," as they are known to predate on many known pests such as cockroaches. If you don't want to share your home with them, we suggest relocating them into your garden instead, where they can continue to be helpful pest control. House centipedes are not known to infest dwellings and if you believe you have an overwhelming number of them in your home, it would be good to consider what their food source may be, and where that food source may be coming from.

    If you believe you need to take control measures:

    - Inspect your home for any underlying pest issue. House centipedes need to feed on something, removing their food source will lead them to go elsewhere.
    - Treat the interior and exterior of your home with Alpine WSG.
    - Place glue traps inside.
    - You may place Hot Shot No-Pest Strips in attics, crawlspaces, unfinished basements, or garages. READ THE LABEL BEFORE PLACING as they can be hazardous to humans if used wrong.
    - Reduce moisture in your home.
